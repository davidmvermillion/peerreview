# DASC 511 Project

# How to Use

The HTML file is the final output. The .png files and *html_support_files* folder all support proper rendering.

I recently switched computers and have had some trouble figuring out how to run pythons scripts correctly on this Mac. As a result, I ran all the code in *DASC_511_Project_Vermillion.ipynb* to generate the HTML. I converted it to *DASC_511_Project_Vermillion.py* for some code cleanup in VS Code, but still couldn't run it there. The script *should* run. However, if it doesn't, the Notebook *really* should run.
